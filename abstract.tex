Some software systems must respond to thousands or millions of concurrent requests. These systems must be properly tested to ensure that they can function correctly under the expected load. A common use of stress testing is to find test scenarios that produce execution times that violate the timing constraints specified. In this context, search-based testing is seen as a promising approach for verifying timing constraints. In this thesis, We proposed  hybrid metaheuristic approach that uses genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search algorithms in a collaborative model using Q-Learning to improve stress search-based  testing and  automation. A tool named IAdapter, a JMeter plugin used for performing search-based stress tests, was developed. Four experiments were conducted to validate the proposed approach.
